			<h2><i class="fa fa-android"></i> Mobile Development</h2>
			<p>As the <em>Lead Android Application Developer</em> for Unitu, I have worked hard over the last year to develop my skills and experience as far as possible.</p>
			<p>The Unitu Android app will soon be released to 2,500 UK university students, and I have worked on a number of other smaller projects. I am currently working on a framework library for fragment-powered apps that I plan to release as an <strong>open-source resource</strong>.</p>
			<p>I also organise and deliver Android programming workshops as part of my work with the KCL Tech Society.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-code"></i> Software Development</h2>
			<p>When working with desktop software I am primarily a <em>Java developer</em>, but I am currently working to develop my skills with <strong>Python</strong>.</p>
			<p>The majority of my desktop programming work falls into two groups: university projects (Java) and personal projects/<strong>hackathon entries</strong> (mixed).</p>
			<p>My projects have included a real-time Twitter analyser, an <strong>RC Raspberry Pi robot</strong>, and I'm currently working on a Wifi-controlled quadcopter.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Teaching</h2>
			<p>I am currently employed by King's College London University as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong>, I have volunteered overseas as a <strong>secondary school teacher</strong>, and as mentioned above I also deliver Android programming courses.</p>
			<p>Although I have no official teaching qualifications, I have received formal training from the Project Trust charity and gained <em>over 500 hours of classroom experience</em> abroad and in the UK.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Website Development</h2>
			<p>I first started working with websites in 2006 and since then I have been involved in server management and UI design, but the majority of my work has been <strong>back-end development</strong>.</p>
			<p>With various technologies I have produced a range of websites, including digital and physical <em>ecommerce</em>, <em>content management</em>, access control and simple profile sites.</p>
			<p>I work mostly with <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL &amp; PHP"><strong>LAMP</strong></abbr> setups, but I am always keen to expand my skills. I will soon be learning <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong>.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-plug"></i> Electronics &amp; PC Hardware</h2>
			<p>After 32 months working as a <strong>PC repair technician</strong> and a lifetime of tinkering with electronics, I have ammassed a range of hardware skills.</p>
			<p>I have built PCs to order, from small servers to large gaming rigs, and worked on a range of personal projects including audio equipment, a 3-axis laser spirograph and some of the projects listed under <strong>Software Development</strong>.</p>

			<h2><i class="fa fa-fire"></i> Other Skills</h2>
			<p>I am currently learning <strong>Spanish</strong> and I occasionally practise a number of circus skills, including diabolo performance, fire eating and fire breathing.</p>
